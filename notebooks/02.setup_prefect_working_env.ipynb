    "# Setup Prefect working env\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with Prefect, you need three things:\n",
    "- Prefect server: Coordinates with worker to run registered workflow\n",
    "- Prefect worker: The compute module which runs the registered workflow\n",
    "- Prefect workflow: The tasks logics which are defined by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Prefect server` is managed by CASD inside each bulle, run as daemon service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users need to manage their workers and workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Prepare your python virtual env for prefect\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "# open a conda shell with python 11\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a dedicated virtual env if you don't have one\n",
    "conda create --name <username>-prefect python=python-version --offline\n",
    "\n",
    "# for example\n",
    "# change pengfei to your name\n",
    "conda create --name pengfei-prefect python --offline\n",
    "\n",
    "# activate your virtual env\n",
    "conda activate pengfei-prefect\n",
    "\n",
    "# install prefect package\n",
    "pip install prefect\n",
    "\n",
    "# check the installed prefect version\n",
    "prefect version\n",
    "\n",
    "# expected output\n",
    "Version:              3.4.25\n",
    "API version:          0.8.4\n",
    "Python version:       3.11.8\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> This virtual env will be used by your prefect worker, if your workflow requires a python package, you need to install the package inside this virtual env. For example, if my workflow uses pyspark, I need to install pyspark inside this virtual env\n",
    "## 2. Register a prefect worker in the prefect server\n",
    "\n",
    "Why CASD does not propose a general worker for everyone? As a workflow may call any python package, we can pre-install all required python packages in a worker, which will slow down the worker. So we propose users to create their own worker and manager their own python package in their worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Check prefect server availability\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, the prefect server runs on `localhost:4200`. You can try to access the Prefect server in your browser by typing `http://localhost:4200`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Configure your registry for the prefect server\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a new powershell terminal, and type the below commands\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "setx PREFECT_HOME \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\prefect_home\"\n",
    "setx PREFECT_API_URL \"http://localhost:4200/api\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Create and register a new worker pool\n",
    "\n",
    "Go back to your virtual env terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "# create a new work pool with your user name\n",
    "prefect work-pool create \"%USERNAME%-pool\" --type process\n",
    "\n",
    "# the you can activate your worker\n",
    "prefect worker start --pool \"%USERNAME%-pool\"\n",
