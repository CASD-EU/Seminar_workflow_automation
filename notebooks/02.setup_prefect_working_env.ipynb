    "# Setup Prefect working env\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with Prefect, you need three things:\n",
    "- Prefect server: Coordinates with worker to run registered workflow\n",
    "- Prefect worker: The compute module which runs the registered workflow\n",
    "- Prefect workflow: The tasks logics which are defined by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Prefect server` is managed by CASD inside each bulle, run as daemon service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users need to manage their workers and workflows.\n",

    "## 1. Prepare your python virtual env for prefect\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "# open a conda shell with python 11\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a dedicated virtual env if you don't have one\n",
    "conda create --name <username>-prefect python=python-version --offline\n",
    "\n",

    "> This virtual env will be used by your prefect worker, if your workflow requires a python package, you need to install the package inside this virtual env. For example, if my workflow uses pyspark, I need to install pyspark inside this virtual env\n",
    "## 2. Register a prefect worker in the prefect server\n",
    "\n",
    "Why CASD does not propose a general worker for everyone? As a workflow may call any python package, we can pre-install all required python packages in a worker, which will slow down the worker. So we propose users to create their own worker and manager their own python package in their worker.\n",
